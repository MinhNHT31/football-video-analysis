# ⚽ Football Video Analysis

This project leverages computer vision to analyze football videos, measuring player speed and distance covered. Using YOLOv8 and Supervision from Roboflow for player tracking, and OpenCV for perspective transformation, this tool provides insights into player movement and performance.

## 📄 Project Overview

The Football Video Analysis tool uses YOLOv8, a real-time object detection model, to detect and track players in football footage. Supervision from Roboflow is used for tracking players across frames, and OpenCV’s perspective transformation functions calculate player speed and distance covered on the field.

## ✨ Features

- **🔍 Player Detection and Tracking**: YOLOv8 and Supervision for accurate, real-time tracking of players.
- **📐 Perspective Transformation**: Using OpenCV to transform video perspective, allowing accurate distance and speed calculations.
- **⚡ Speed Measurement**: Calculates the speed of each tracked player based on movement in each frame.
- **📏 Distance Covered**: Measures distance covered by each player over time.
